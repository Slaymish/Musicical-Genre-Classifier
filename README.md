# Music Genre Classifier

- Trained on kaggle dataset

The data is provided as 11 comma-separated values (.csv) files in two folders. The “training-data” folder contains ten csv data files, which are the training data for the ten genres. They should be used to construct a model to predict the genre of music an instance belongs to. Each of the ten files contains 5,000 instances all belonging to one genre of music. Total there are 10 * 5,000 = 50,000 training instances.
